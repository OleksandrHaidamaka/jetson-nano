# ISP Configuration for Low Light - Real AR0234 V4L2 Controls
# Use Case: Indoor lighting, evening, dim environments
# Goal: Enhance visibility while managing noise

exposure_auto=1                     # Manual mode for precise exposure control
exposure_time_absolute=2000         # Longer exposure (2000Î¼s) to capture more light
gain=8                              # Moderate gain boost (8x vs 1x) for sensitivity
brightness=1                        # Slight brightness increase (+1) for dark scenes
contrast=12                         # Enhanced contrast (12 vs 10) to separate details
saturation=18                       # Boosted colors (18 vs 16) that fade in low light
gamma=200                           # Lower gamma (200 vs 220) reveals shadow details
white_balance_automatic=0           # Manual white balance for indoor lighting control
white_balance_temperature=3200      # Warm temperature (3200K) for indoor/tungsten lights
denoise=10                          # Higher noise reduction (10 vs 8) for gain-induced noise
sharpness=12                        # Moderate sharpening (12 vs 16) to avoid noise amplification
roi_window_size=24                  # Larger ROI (24px vs 8px) for better exposure metering
exposure_compensation=25000         # Higher compensation (25000 vs 16000) for brightness
